# RNA-SEQ-ANALYSIS-PIPELINE


RNA-SEQ analysis enables us to identify genes or transcripts that are significantly expressed across conditions. It can often be a daunting task setting up a computational environment to perform this task. This tutorial attempts to reduce this burden by providing  step by step instructions on how to perform such analysis. This document is based on a tutorial by Dave Tang (https://davetang.org/muse/2017/10/25/getting-started-hisat-stringtie-ballgown/).
