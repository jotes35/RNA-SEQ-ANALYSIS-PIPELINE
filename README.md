# RNA-SEQ-ANALYSIS-PIPELINE


it can often be a daunting task setting up a computational environment to perform this task. This tutorial attempts to reduce this burden by providing a number of already made scripts to perform a gene expression analysis. This document is based on a tutorial by Dave Tang. In this tutorial we make things a bit easier by automating a number of tasks and provide materials which can be used on other datasets by entering a few information. A general workflow of gene expression analysis involves QC, mapping, transcript assembly, quantification, normalization,differential expression , gene enrichment analysis

The pipeline vailable  starts from mapping to differential expression
